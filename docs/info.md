## How it works

This project implements a SPI-controlled PWM peripheral. It features:
- SPI interface for configuration (SCLK, COPI, nCS)
- 16 PWM outputs with individual enable control
- Configurable duty cycle (0-255 = 0-100%)
- 3 kHz PWM frequency

## How to test

1. Configure output enables via SPI registers 0x00-0x03
2. Set PWM duty cycle via register 0x04
3. Monitor outputs with an oscilloscope or logic analyzer
4. Use provided test bench to verify:
   - PWM frequency (3 kHz Â±1%)
   - Duty cycle accuracy
   - Output enable functionality

## External hardware

No external hardware required for basic testing. For hardware validation:
- Logic analyzer or oscilloscope to verify PWM signals
- SPI master device for control (can be FPGA, microcontroller, etc)
